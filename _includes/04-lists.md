## Introduction
Trying things iny my way made me who I am today, Achivements I got and milstone I've received pawed my 
way untill now. I driven by four most important believes. 
 1. Learn
 2. Try
 3. Fail
 4. Archive
These are my 4 most trusted pillars which taught me important skills such as transforming, learning and buiding up. The first 5 year of my coorporate carrier, the projects I've worked on taught me how much time and performance values. That's a lesson which no professor can taught us.
